            <h3>Welcome to the about section of this website (and me) :3</h3>
            <p>Well first off, welcome to my little website. I have spent around 2.5 years on website creation / design<br>
            I made this website as what used to be a personal website but I have now converted it to a school games website<br>
            If you refer to me please use they / them or call me by my online names "Goobstqr" (pronouced Goobster) or "Ferret"<br>
            I do like to do a little bit of messing around :3<br>
            Also for the other students that go to the same school as me, I was the original supplier of Untitled Goose Game and Ravenfield<br>
            My favourite animals are ferrets, opossums and raccoons</p>
